-- are in decreasing order.

---------------------- Additional SQL Queries ----------------------
-- For the user with id = 1, find the board name, thread id, thread subject,
-- and date bookmarked associated with each of the userâ€™s bookmarks.
-- Then, sort the rows by the date bookmarked, with the newest bookmarks being at the top.
